            <h2>What is My Long Term Goal and or Career Pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                My long term goal is to get a job doing any sort of development work in an Agile environment for a
                living. Dev Ops is something that I’d be keen to explore further in future. I’d also like to feel
                confident enough to work on my own my projects and contribute to open source software.
            </p>
            <h2>What Non-Technical Skills Would I Like to Develop While at EDA?</h2>
            <p>
                I think being able to work in a team is hugely important as I know from past experience that you’ll
                rarely be working in a silo. I’d like to develop my collaborative skills further, especially within the
                context of web development.
            </p>
            <h2>What are My Own Strengths and Limitations?</h2>
            <p>
                I’d say my strengths are my imagination, problem solving skills and having a curiosity to explore and
                find things out myself. Being reasonably computer literate and a genuine interest in development and
                technology, I think, is also a big plus.
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest limitation is that if I’m working by myself, I tend to lack motivation to do things that
                don’t
                capture my interest. This usually results in me procrastinating.
            </p>
            <p>
                To mitigate this, setting Pomodoro timers has helped me to get through areas that I don’t enjoy. Working
                in short stints knowing I’ll have a small break is a great way to trick my brain into doing things it
                doesn’t want. I think being aware of my limitations helps to try and keep myself accountable. If I’m
                working with a team however, me not wanting to let people down is motivation enough at times.
            </p>
            <h2>How Will I Seek Help in a Timely Manner?</h2>
            <p>
                First I’d try to find the answer myself and figure out how to solve the problem on my own. If I’m still
                stuck I’d reach out to others in my cohort, otherwise other developers I’ve worked with in the past or
                the EDA facilitators.
            </p>
            <h2>What are My Expectations for the Facilitation Team</h2>
            <p>
                I’d expect the facilitation team to provide the minimum amount of tools and/or knowledge to be able to
                do
                what I need effectively. I’d also expect them to give constructive feedback on both my technical and
                human skills. I also find regular check ins to be super valuable.
            </p>
            <h2>Any Future Commitments that I Need to Block out Time For?</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t foresee any future commitments that I need to make time for, but if I was to be working with
                anyone I’d be sure to give everyone involved notice beforehand.
