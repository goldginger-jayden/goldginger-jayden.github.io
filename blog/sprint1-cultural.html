            <p>
                I’ve taken the Myers Briggs personality test several times in my life and I always seem to come up as
                INFP-T (Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Perception – Turbulent) or the Mediator... Which is
                apparently one of the rarest personality types 🤷‍♀️
            </p>
            <p>
                The stronger parts of my personality have allowed me to flourish at times. I’ve worked as a Test
                Analyst and as a Product Analyst in an Agile environment and I feel like web development will allow me
                to play to my strengths even more, while further improving my weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find it easy to empathise with others, even if I haven’t experienced that persons situation myself.
                Which is both a strength and a weakness (in some situations). I used to work for a debt collection
                department in a call centre and found it very difficult. I’m not comfortable describing peoples personal
                situations, but there were moments where I was too compassionate (for the role) with some people. In
                order to do well in that job I had to work on trying not to take on other peoples baggage, I managed to
                do so to the point where I think I was getting by (I didn't get fired)
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve had situations in the past where my altruism and empathy has been taken advantage of and I’m
                positive that working in debt collection was one of them. Something I’ve learned in recent years is
                to <b>"Put On Your Own Oxygen Mask First”</b> If not for myself but for others.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my career I’ve also worked in a managerial position and didn’t particularly enjoy it. I struggled
                with being a person that could be a source of tension in the workplace. I’ve come to realise that people
                management isn’t for me. I much prefer harmony, not rocking the boat and getting along with others. (As
                long is it doesn't go against my core beliefs) In my experience of being a people manager, it didn't
                often allow for flexing my creative and imaginative side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also tend to take things personally. Receiving feedback is important. If not for affirmation that
                you're doing the right thing, but also for self improvement. I tend to have a lot of self doubt. In
                the past, I’ve had to learn to take careful consideration to negative feedback and not perceive it as a
                personal attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                People also find me difficult to get to know at first. I’m reasonably introverted, private and don’t
                open up unless I feel safe. Once I am comfortable however I tend to overshare 😅
            </p>
            <p>
                As an INFP-T, I found writing this and going into as much detail as I have quite difficult but I hope it
                gives you a small insight into the kind of person I am! 💜
