            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>
                Emotion Intelligence relates to the ability of understanding and managing your own emotions, and through
                this, being able to understand and affect the emotions of others.
            </p>
            <h2>How is it Different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>
                IQ relates to general intelligence, analytical thinking, logic and reasoning etc...
            </p>
            <h2>Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Having a good level of emotional intelligence is important as it allows you to better perceive and
                regulate your own emotional state, and in turn, read other people better. I feel like this hugely
                important, especially when working with others. In the workplace, you‚Äôll rarely be working alone so
                being able function in a team is a huge benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my personal experience I‚Äôve worked in teams where everyone gets along and understands each other, due
                to this you can get a lot done and enjoy your time at work. When one person is self centered and/or has
                low emotional intelligence it can negatively impact the dynamics and productivity of a team.
            </p>
