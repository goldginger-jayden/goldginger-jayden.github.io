            <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity relates to how the brain isn‚Äôt static and can form new connections or pathways through
                things such as practice and learning. The more you do something, the stronger those connections in the
                brain become and your ability to recall information or preform actions becomes greater in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing this is a great motivator to continue learning and practicing writing code everyday, as
                over time the pathways in the brain responsible for this will improve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Practice is a great way to improve neuroplasticity, especially when it comes to things such as learning
                a language or a musical instrument. Sleeping is another great way to ‚Äúsweep out the cobwebs‚Äù in your
                brain. A good nights sleep helps to make you more engaged and focused so you‚Äôre better able to absorb
                new knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other things like reading or travelling are great as they help to stimulate the brain. Even things like
                meditation, intermittent fasting and regular exercise are great tools for improving neuroplasticity.
            </p>

            <h2>What is a Growth Mindset?</h2>
            <p>
                Having a Growth Mindset (versus a Fixed Mindset) is a belief that you‚Äôre able develop your talents, to
                solve problems and eventually understand something rather than believing that you‚Äôre not smart enough.
                Having a fixed mindset can hinder your learning as a result of your brain having a tendency to avoid
                problems and not giving them a proper go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning about the growth mindset has been quite interesting to me as I have a bit of a fixed mindset,
                if something isn‚Äôt interesting to me, and I struggle with it, I‚Äôll avoid it. Only if I‚Äôm really invested
                in something will I ever give it the time required to improve. This is something that I want to change
                about myself, and it‚Äôs great knowing that I‚Äôm capable, I just need to put in the effort and have
                patience in myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through things like positive affirmation and meditation and even knowing about the growth mindset can
                have a positive impact and help you better engage with problems. A key thing I took away from my reading
                was that you should form good habits, be kind to yourself, and allow yourself to fail, so you can
                improve.
            </p>
