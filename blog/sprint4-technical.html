            <h2>Getting Blocked</h2>
            <p>
                I find the more things I try to cram into my head in a day, the easier it is for me to get blocked on
                what should be a simple problem. An example of this was during an exercise this sprint where tests were
                already written and you had to write the code to make the tests past. The test was telling me that "The
                value of the adam children property should be equal to the value of the terah children property".
                Through trial and error I eventually got there. I had already written the property for terah.children
                and all I needed to do was write "adam.children = terah.children" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found that it's been crucial to identify when I'm getting tunnel vision and trying to solve a
                problem in one particular way. When I notice this I just walk away from my screen and go do something
                else. Once I come back, I feel less frustrated, the problem becomes less of a big deal and I'm more open
                to trying other solutions. A healthy dose of using Google to learn about terms and reading documentation
                also helps a ton!
            </p>
            <h2>Solving Problems</h2>
            <p>
                It's a great feeling when you attack a problem and solve it quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                A bit of background first: One of the exercises this sprint gets you to use some of the built in
                functions of Javascript. An earlier problem in this exercise took a lot of pseudocode (Basically writing
                a recipe for the steps you need to take to get the end result you're after), Googling the "map" function
                and explaining my problem out loud (the Rubber ducky method). I eventually got there by adapting some
                code I found online. Even though I only had a partial understanding of what I had written, it worked!
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, later in this exercise I realised one of the problems could be solved by reusing some of this
                code that I had written earlier! I brought it down, and used console.log to print out what it was doing,
                and then by using a little bit of trial and error and some tweaking to my code, it made the tests pass!
            </p>
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Pseudocode! Write your solution in steps first (as if you're writing a recipe without knowing the
                    quantities)</li>
                <li>Take Regular Breaks</li>
                <li>When taking breaks, walk away from the screen and do something else. This helps take your mind off
                    the problem so when you come back, you look at things with fresh eyes</li>
                <li>Discuss your problem with a friend or family member (or even a rubber duck?!) Just this act of
                    communicating a problem in plain language can help to reframe the problem in your mind</li>
                <li>Trial and Error. Try something! Use the console! Get the console to log what you're trying to do so
                    you can actually see what your code is doing and adapt accordingly</li>
                <li>Google! Read up about a function you're trying to use or even how someone else might have solved a
                    problem. This can give you inspiration for your own.</li>
            </ul>
