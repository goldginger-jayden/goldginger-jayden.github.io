			<h1>What are the Best Practices Associated with Using Classes vs. IDs? 🤔</h1>
			
			<h3>12 September 2020</h3>
		</header>

		<main>
			<p>
				This question actually came up in my own experience of building this site. From what I can gather, in
				general, you want to use classes for elements that you'll be reusing a lot. IDs are used to single out
				one specific element on a page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Classes and IDs can be used in conjunction with each other though! If you wanted to call out one
				specific
				area to change it's styling, you can! Any styling done to an ID that's also part of a class will inherit
				or override that classes style.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the case of this site I wanted the main header to be a specific font size but for
				other main (h1) headings to not be affected. In order to accomplish this I gave it an id of
				"main-header". I have styling applied for headers already so all I needed to do was to give the main
				heading an id and give it it's own font size.

			<h2>To summarise:</h2>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>You can use the same class on any (or all) elements on an individual page!</li>
				<li>You can use as many classes as you'd like on the same element</li>
				<li>You can only use one ID per element</li>
				<li>On an individual page you should only have one element with that unique ID</li>
			</ul>
