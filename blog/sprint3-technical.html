			<h2>What's the Difference Between HTML and CSS?</h2>
			<p>
				Think of HTML like the script and stage for a play and CSS as the actors, set dressing and costuming.
				CSS gives style to the HTML base. Javascript then comes in and adds special effects, sounds and other
				magic! üò±
			</p>
			<h2>What is Control Flow and How are Loops Related?</h2>
			<p>
				Control flow is the process of code execution in a loop. Think of stirring a pot of sauce that you're
				making for dinner. The stirring motion is pretty repetitive and you don't need someone giving you
				instructions for every rotation of your spoon in the pot. So we can have a control flow to keep
				stirring, in order to stop once it's boiled we need to write a loop. Say if the recipe said to stir for
				5 minutes we could use that as our loop condition.
			</p>
			<p>
				So to summarise, control flow is a set of instructions that's to be repeated in a specific order, and
				the loop
				is designed to stop it once a certain condition is met.
			</p>
			<h2>What's the DOM?</h2>
			<p>
				The DOM is a like a tree or a structure. Different points on the page represent a leaf (or node) that
				are connected with branches. By calling on different parts on this tree in code, we can change or
				interact with them.
				Another example might be like a folder structure on your computer, with other nested folders and
				documents inside them.
				Or maybe even a calendar? With the current year being the parent, then nested under that is the months,
				and inside months are the days, then inside the days are hours etc...
			</p>
			<h2>What's the Difference Between Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects?</h2>
			<p>
				Objects are used for storing lots of information under one thing, say information about a movie.
				You can have an object called "The Shawshank Redemption" and then all the information about that movie
				underneath, like the year it was released, the director, etc. An array
				could then be used to store multiple bits of information to same variable. Seeing as multiple people
				starred in the film, you could store these under one array called "starring"
			</p>
			<h2>What are Functions and Why are They Useful?</h2>
			<p>
				Functions are like a sub program, say if you wanted a coffee, you could have the instructions on how to
				make one put into a function called "makeCoffee". Whenever you want to make a coffee now, you can just
				use your function "makeCoffee" instead rewriting the instructions on how to make one every time.
