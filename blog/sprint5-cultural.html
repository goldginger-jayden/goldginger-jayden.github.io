            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I‚Äôve learned that I can quite harsh on myself and I feel like I‚Äôve become more self aware of my
                emotions. Through this I‚Äôve been better at taking breaks and not giving up as quickly as I used to. I
                feel like it‚Äôs made me more resilient.
            </p>
            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Values, empathy and self awareness are hugely important for your own learning, programming or anything
                in life really. Especially when you deal with other people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Self awareness for when your emotions aren‚Äôt quite right and you notice yourself getting easily
                frustrated, it might be time to step away for a moment to decompress. Once you come back when you‚Äôre
                feeling more able to cope, a task that may have felt monumental before isn‚Äôt so bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Self awareness when working with others is great as your emotions may change how you come across to
                someone. Empathy for yourself and others is hugely important as you need to be kind to yourself and
                realise when you might be a self saboteur, and with others to be receptive and as non
                judgemental as possible when don‚Äôt necessarily know a persons own personal situation.
            </p>
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Nothing major surprised me about the core learnings. I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to see some of these
                practices work really well within a company I used to work, but also unfortunate enough to see changes
                where these practices break down, and eventuate in a toxic work environment.
            </p>
            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>
                The most challenging thing I think is challenging your own perceptions, to some it might seem silly but
                I think with time and practice you might realise how much of an impact it can have in your own personal
                and work life.
            </p>
            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development bootcamp course?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Because it‚Äôs hugely valuable to have someone with the core skills to help shape and influence a healthy
                work culture. Ultimately I think it makes people better humans for themselves and for others around
                them.
            </p>
            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
                that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
            <p>
                Not a waste of time at all. It helped to explain why I‚Äôve seen some of these things practised in the
                past. And through my own reflections I feel like it‚Äôs been hugely valuable. I think these skills are
                something I‚Äôd like to continue to grow and develop for the rest of my life, regardless of what
                profession I might end up in.
            </p>
            <h1>Preparing for Bootcamp</h1>
            <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>
                After Dev Academy, I‚Äôm hoping to get a developer role in a software company that properly practices
                Agile. I‚Äôd ideally like to work for a company that has values similarly aligned to my own and does some
                social good. I‚Äôd also like to be able to contribute to open source projects and be able to work on my
                own.
            </p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <p>
                I think my biggest strength in bootcamp will be my analytical mindset, imagination and my love for
                problem solving. My biggest limitation will be combating procrastination, especially if I‚Äôm doing
                something that I‚Äôm not enjoying. I feel like I‚Äôve developed a greater self awareness of when I‚Äôm doing
                so and I‚Äôm trying to keep myself accountable. I can‚Äôt afford to procrastinate during bootcamp as it‚Äôll
                mean that I‚Äôll get behind in my work.
            </p>
            <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <p>
                I think the biggest non-technical challenge for me will be keeping my stress and mental health in check.
                If that falls over, then completing bootcamp will be significantly harder.
            </p>
            <h2>What non-technical skills <b>human skills</b> would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Human skills I‚Äôd like to develop during bootcamp would be my self awareness and communication skills. I
                feel like these are areas that I need some improvement in. In general though I‚Äôd like to hope that I‚Äôd
                develop other skills further too.
            </p>
            <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>
                I‚Äôd expect myself to keep facilitators and other people I‚Äôm working with in the loop as to where I‚Äôm at.
                If I‚Äôm struggling I‚Äôd expect to give something a decent attempt before reaching out to others in my
                cohort, or facilitators, for help. I don‚Äôt want to be in a situation where I spend a whole day stuck on
                one task.
